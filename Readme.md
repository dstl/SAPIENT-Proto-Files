# BSI Flex 355
BSI Flex 335 specifies the interfaces within a SAPIENT (Sensing for Asset Protection with Integrated Electronic Networked Technology) system.  Specifically, it addresses the interfaces between edge nodes, the fusion node and any message handling application.  

This repository provides protobuf aligned to the interfaces defined in BSI Flex 335

## SAPIENT Summary
*For more details see the Standard above*

SAPIENT is a concept that describes a system comprised of a suite of autonomous edge nodes, which may have sensor or effector (or both) capabilities combined with remote modules that perform fusion and node tasking. 
The key principles of SAPIENT are:

1) 	local autonomy at the edge; i.e. local processing of sensor data where the nodes are sensor edge nodes ;
2) 	the transmission of information (the output of the processing) rather than the raw data from the sensor edge node;
3) 	the fusion of information at remote fusion nodes and the generation of tasking messages for taskable edge nodes (sensor edge nodes or effector nodes), and;
4) 	local autonomous execution of received taskings at taskable edge nodes (sensor edge nodes or effector nodes).

When combined as a system, these principles give the following desirable features:
*	reduction in operator workload during monitoring activities; 
*	improved autonomy for decision making; 
*	improved autonomy for management of edge nodes;
*	lower bandwidth requirements for network traffic, and;
*	node modularity â€“ nodes of different types (particularly sensor edge nodes) use the same interface for communication whatever their modality.
